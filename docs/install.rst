Installation
========================================

Python Basic is installed via pip.

Use:
.. code-block:: sh
    
    pip install pythonbasic

Then, in your code editor:
.. code-block:: python
    
    import pythonbasic as pb

.. note:: The import name doesn't really matter, but it is recommended to keep it short - you'll be typing it a lot!

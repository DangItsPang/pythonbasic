**Installation**
========================================

Python Basic is installed via pip.

Use:
.. code-block::
    ``pip install pythonbasic``

Then, in your code editor:
.. code-block::
    ``import pythonbasic as pb``

.. admonition:: Note
    :class: note
   
    The import name doesn't really matter, but it is recommended to keep it short - you'll be typing it a lot!

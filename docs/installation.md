# Installation
Installing Python Basic is very simple.

Using pip, type:

```shell
pip install pythonbasic
```

After that, you can import the module into your project:

```python
import pythonbasic as pb
```

Now that you've installed Python Basic, why not create your first program, a [function-based program](./function_program.md)?
